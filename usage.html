				</li>
				<li>The time it takes for the solvent to completely evaporate is subject to the temperature but usually about 3 to 5 days then the reaction fixation ends.</li>
				<li>Do not spread or drip any water on the treated surface within 24 hours.</li>
				<li>If mouth or eye gets in touch with MEKKING, immediately rinse mouth or eye with sufficient water and seek medical attention.</li>
				<li>If MEKKING was applied to skin or wipe, immediately rinse with water.</li>
				<li>Keep MEKKING tightly closed and stored in cool and dark areas out of reach by children. Please refrain from pouring MEKKING into other containers from its original package for storage except for transportation purpose.</li>
				<li>When applying MEKKING, ensure the working space is equipped with ventilator to provide good ventilation.</li>
				<li>In order to prevent skin from exposing to MEKKING, please make sure to use protection, such as gas masks, gloves, goggles, aprons etc.</li>
				<li>Please thoroughly wash hands after using MEKKING</li>
				<li>Please refrain from using MEKKING other than its intended purposes</li>
