			<h4 class="bold-title">Corrosion resistance would dramatically improve.</h4>
			<p>There are numerous holes invisible to our eyes but exist on the surface of chrome plating. Once water or dust get into such holes, plating starts getting rusted. ※ Although chrome plating itself is extremely corrosion resistant, rust occurs from the small holes. MEKKING is designed to fill up these holes therefore it will give dramatic improvements of the corrosion resistance.</p>

						<strong>MEKKING stays strong even with sea water.</strong>

						<strong>Even great for European car plating malls!</strong>
						<p>MEKKING is also great for European car plating malls! In fact, European car plating malls are often made of alumite, not chrome plating, and are easy to corrode.</p>
						<p>European cars can keep their shine by applying MEKKING among the brand new cars!</p>
						<p>Simultaneously with the purchase of a new car, MEKKING's regular coating will solve the problem of corrosion peculiar to European cars. I would definitely recommend MEKKING for a mall that has already been corroded and has been polished well after removing corrosion. It is very effective in preventing corrosion.</p>
						<p>(※ The corrosion of the alumite is not so powerful with SABITORI KING, so please remove the corrosion with an aluminum compound, etc., and apply the MEKING coating in a clean condition.)</p>

			<article>
				<p>Recently, there are negative images that "plating is easy to be rusty, peeled off, or difficult to handle"<br>Such images are brought from low quality due to the reduction of manufacturing cost in recent years, but we can not do anything about such currents. The original "glow of plating" is superb.<br>I couldn't stand with hearing the bad reputation of plating because of those low quality plating. Therefore, I developed MEKKING, a magic protective agent for plating which keeps the shine and has good corrosion-resistance.</p>
				<strong>Attention of use</strong>
				<ul type="square" class="pad_lt20">
					<li>I think it's best to protect plating, not wipe it. There are many products with abrasive materials such as wax, when you keep cleaning with such products, the more chrome plating will come off.</li>
					<li>After the MEKKING application, you no longer need to apply wax. The reason for this is that wax is the role of protecting the metal coating by oxidizing itself before metal is oxidized with oil as the main ingredient, but it also causes rust to be caused by the corrosion of the oil. MEKKING is a glass coating, so it is very hard to oxidize compared to oil.</li>
					<li>Mekking is also very effective for chrome-plated plastic parts. (Because the plating is thin, it is good for prevention of peeling.)</li>
					<li>SABITORI KING  is an excellent product that removes rust without affecting chrome plating. The SABITORI KING also has an extra-large half-size magic wipe that removes dirt from the plating in order not to damage it.</li>
					<li>Please use the Japan's best "MEKKKING" plating protective agent, and the "SABITORI KING" which is gentle to plating and strict to rust.</li>
				</ul>
			</article>

			<h2 class="main-title">Characteristics of chrome plating</h2>
			<ul class="check-list">
				<li>Beautiful looking!</li>
				<li>Protects against the color change in the atmosphere!</li>
				<li>Great corrosion resistance</li>
				<p>It is often used in the outer parts of motorcycles, cars and trucks, but its greatest weakness is rust.<br>That is...<br>There are countless invisible holes, where water and dust enter, and the underlying plating rusts.</p>
				<p>※ Chromium plating itself is so difficult to corrode that it rusts inside the hole before rust on the chrome!</p>
			</ul>
			<div class="four-stage">
				<figure>
					<img src="inc/img/mekking/stage1.png" alt="stage1" />
					<p>The initial stage<br>The occurance of water spots</p>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="inc/img/mekking/stage2.png" alt="stage2" />
					<p>The middle stage<br>The occurance of spotty rusts</p>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="inc/img/mekking/stage3.png" alt="stage3" />
					<p>The plating, which increases rust, may swell or peel.</p>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="inc/img/mekking/stage4.png" alt="stage4" />
					<p>The chrome plating on the surface will peel off, and in the end, it will be too late if you don't take care of it at the beginning or at least the middle stage of the process, in a form that is deplorable.<br>At the end of life, it is not possible to regenerate unless it is re-plated or the parts are purchased again.</p>
				</figure>

			<h2 class="main-title">As for chrome plating maintenance, is wax useless for it?</h2>
			<p>I get asked such questions a lot. It has advantages and disadvantages.The advantage is that the principal ingredient is oil, so the price is low.<br>The disadvantage is that since oil is the main ingredient, it protects the metal coating by oxidizing the oil (wax) before the metal is oxidized, but it also causes rust by the corrosion of the oil.</p>
			<p>For example,<br>It is the same as women's makeup; if you don't apply it frequently, it is similar to making your skin rough.<br>The biggest disadvantage is that if you polish the wax with a lot of abrasive material, the more you polish it, the more chrome plating you may lose.</p>
			<p>※ The gold colored part looks smoldering because the chrome plating is taken off and the underlying nickel plating is produced.<br>※ No matter how much you polish a single metal, for example, stainless steel, the base is stainless, so there is no problem, but you can see clearly in this image why chrome plating should not be polished.</p>
			<div class="center-image">
				<img src="inc/img/mekking/maintenance.jpg" alt="maintenance" width="600" />
			</div>

			<h2 class="main-title">The chrome plating film is extremely thin!</h2>
			<p>The thickness of the chrome plating used for decoration is about 0.02-0.2 microns.</p>
			<p>※ 1 micron=1/1000 mm</p>
			<p>You can see that the chrome plating film is very thin.<br>The chrome plating is base plating (copper plating + nickel plating) and is thick.</p>
			<div class="center-image">
				<img src="inc/img/mekking/thin.png" alt="thin" width="500" />
			</div>
			
			<h2 class="main-title">Bad use case</h2>
			<p>Waxing with towels, etc., and ruffling ... full of flaws<br>This is the worst thing to do! Be careful when you polish with cloth, towel, etc!<br>※ Because it has the property of spreading dirt, it is easy to pull and damage if there is dirt. Because the chrome plating has a high mirror surface, it gets scratched and stands out due to small things.<br>※ It will be very difficult to repair it once it has been damaged.</p>
			<p>The correct answer is not to polish chrome plating but to rub it gently.</p>
			<p>So what would be the best method for the chrome plating maintenance?<br>It is best to protect chrome plating instead of polishing it.</p>
			<p>The weak point of chrome plating? → Holes.<br>Corrosion resistance of chrome plating? → Good / Satisfactory<br>What are the remediation measures? → If you cover up this hole, it will quickly increase corrosion resistance.</p>

			<h2 class="main-title">Stainless steel doesn't rust easily, does it?</h2>
			<p>Stainless steel is made of an alloy of nickel and chrome metals.<br>In other words, chrome plating, if it were to fill even this hole, would yield a corrosion resistance comparable to that of sterility. AND! MEKKING is the one which would block the hole!! Usually, the gloss gets damaged when something is coated on the plated surface, but MEKKING is done by applying a chrome brightener while improving the specularity of the plated surface. That's why the chrome's distinctive blue light increases after application when you use MEKKING!!</p>
			<p>You might want to remove rust before coat it with plating. 『SABITORI KING』is for that moment! It is an excellent product that removes rust without removing plating without affecting chrome plating.<br>(The rust that cannot be obtained by the rust-triggering can only be reproduced by the plating.) </p>
